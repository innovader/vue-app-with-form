# vue-app-with-form

## Assignment conclusion
```
It took me 4 days to made it to this point on this assignment. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue3 framework.

My main focus was the contact form functionality, the responsiveness of the application and the positioning of the elements.
I used one breakpoint at 1200px width as it seemed a good idea for this particular app and its structure.

The mobile menu icon, when clicked it opens a mock-up menu/navigation. On desktop the navigation is a mock-up.

The herobanner slideshow is just a mock-up image.

The contact form has validation, the select dropdowns do a GET call on load as asked and populate the subcategory fields accordingly to selected category.
I didn't have time to add error and success states to inputs or the 'nice to have' validations.
